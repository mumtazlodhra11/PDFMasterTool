# 🚀 START HERE - Lambda Container Build

## 📍 Current Status

✅ All 5 Lambda container configurations ready  
✅ Docker Desktop installed  
❌ Docker Desktop NOT running  

---

## 🎯 What You Need To Do NOW

### Step 1: Start Docker Desktop (2 minutes)

**Windows:**
```
1. Press Windows key
2. Type: "Docker Desktop"
3. Click to open
4. Wait for whale icon in system tray (bottom-right)
5. Icon should be WHITE/BLUE (not red/yellow)
```

**Wait until Docker is fully started!**

---

### Step 2: Run Build Script (40 minutes)

**Open PowerShell/Command Prompt and run:**

```bash
cd D:\PDFMasterTool\aws\lambda-containers
.\build-and-deploy-all.bat
```

**Then:**
- ☕ Go get coffee
- 🍕 Have lunch
- 📺 Watch a video
- ⏰ Come back in 40 minutes

The script will:
1. ✅ Login to AWS ECR
2. ✅ Create repositories
3. ✅ Build 5 Docker images with LibreOffice (THIS TAKES TIME!)
4. ✅ Push to AWS
5. ✅ Update Lambda functions

---

## ⏱️ Build Time

```
Expected: 35-45 minutes

Why?
- LibreOffice is ~200MB
- Needs to download and install 5 times
- First build is slow
- Future updates are FAST (2-3 min)
```

**Q: What if I close the terminal?**  
A: Just run the script again. It will continue where it left off.

**Q: Can I skip this and use CloudConvert?**  
A: Yes, but it costs $30/month vs $3-5/month.

**Q: How often do I need to rebuild?**  
A: ONCE! Only rebuild if you change the code.
