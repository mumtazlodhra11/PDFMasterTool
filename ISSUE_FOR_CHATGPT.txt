I need help with Docker Desktop on Windows 10.

PROBLEM:
Docker Desktop is installed (version 28.5.1) but won't start properly.

When I run: docker ps
I get: "Error response from daemon: Docker Desktop is unable to start"

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
1. Started Docker Desktop.exe - it launches but daemon doesn't become ready
2. Waited 2.5 minutes - Docker never becomes responsive
3. Running on Windows 10 Build 26100 with PowerShell 7

SYSTEM INFO:
- OS: Windows 10 (Build 26100)
- Docker: version 28.5.1, build e180ab8
- Shell: PowerShell 7
- Path: C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe

WHY THIS MATTERS:
I need Docker to build container images for AWS Lambda functions. Everything else is ready (AWS configured, code ready, Dockerfiles ready) but Docker not starting is blocking the entire deployment.

QUESTION:
How do I fix Docker Desktop so it starts properly on Windows 10? What could be causing this and what should I check?

Possible causes I'm thinking:
- WSL2 not configured?
- Hyper-V disabled?
- Virtualization disabled?
- Docker service not starting?
- Need to reinstall?

Please provide step-by-step solution to get Docker Desktop running.
