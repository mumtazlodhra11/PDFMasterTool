                  Most tools run fully in your browser using client-side processing. Your files never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy. Only heavy conversions that require more processing power use our secure Cloud Run backend temporarily, and files are deleted immediately after processing. We never store your files.

                  Most tools support up to 150MB files, which is higher than most competitors (typically 20-50MB). For very large files, we recommend using the compress tool first to reduce file size before processing.

                  Yes! PDFEliteTools is fully responsive and works on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. Some tools like Mobile Scanner are specifically designed for mobile use. However, for best results with large files, we recommend using a desktop browser.

                  First, try refreshing the page and clearing your browser cache. Make sure you're using a supported browser and that your file meets the size requirements.

                  Some tools can work with password-protected PDFs if you enter the password when prompted. However, certain operations may require the PDF to be unlocked first. Use our Unlock PDF tool if you need to remove password protection.

                  Processing time depends on file size, complexity, and the type of operation. Large files, files with many pages, or complex operations like OCR may take longer. If processing seems stuck, try refreshing the page and uploading the file again.
