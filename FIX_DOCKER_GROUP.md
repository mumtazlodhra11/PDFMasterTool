2. Select **Computer Management**
3. Navigate to:
   - **Local Users and Groups** ‚Üí **Groups**
4. Double-click **docker-users**
5. Click **Add...**
6. Type your username
7. Click **Check Names**
8. Click **OK**
9. **Restart computer**

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Run Docker as Administrator (Quick Test)

**Temporary workaround (not recommended for production):**

1. Close Docker Desktop completely
2. Right-click Docker Desktop icon
3. Select **Run as administrator**
4. This should work immediately

## üöÄ After Fix - Verify Docker Works

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Should see empty list (no containers running yet)
```

---

## üí° Why This Happens?

Docker on Windows requires users to be in the `docker-users` group for security. When you install Docker, it creates this group but doesn't always add your user automatically.

---

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### **Quick Fix (5 minutes):**

```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell as Admin
# 2. Run this:
net localgroup docker-users %USERNAME% /add

# 3. Restart computer
shutdown /r /t 0

# 4. After restart, Docker will work!
```

---

## ‚ùì Still Not Working?

### Check if docker-users group exists:

```powershell
net localgroup docker-users
```

Should show:
```
Alias name     docker-users
Comment        docker-users group

Members
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YourUsername
```

### If group doesn't exist, reinstall Docker:

1. Uninstall Docker Desktop
2. Download latest version: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
3. Install as Administrator
4. During install, check "Add user to docker-users group"

## üö® Alternative: Skip Docker Containers

If Docker issues persist, we have alternatives:

### Option A: Use CloudConvert API ($30/month)

- Paid service

### Option B: Deploy to AWS Cloud9 / EC2
- Build containers on AWS directly
- No local Docker needed
- More complex

### Option C: Focus on 19 Client-Side Tools
- Skip Lambda document conversion tools
- Launch with 19 working tools
- Add Lambda later

## üéØ What To Do Now?

### **Recommended: Fix Docker Group**

```bash
# 1. Open PowerShell AS ADMIN
# 2. Run:
net localgroup docker-users %USERNAME% /add

# 3. Restart computer
# 4. Come back and we'll continue!
```
