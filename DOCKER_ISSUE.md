# Docker Desktop Issue - Exact Problem

## Error Summary

**Docker Desktop is installed but fails to start on Windows 10.**

---

## Environment Details

- **OS**: Windows 10 (Build 26100)
- **Docker Version**: Docker version 28.5.1, build e180ab8
- **Shell**: PowerShell 7
- **Installation Path**: C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe

---

## Exact Error

When running:
```powershell
docker ps
```

**Error message:**
```
Error response from daemon: Docker Desktop is unable to start
```

---

## What We've Tried

1. **Started Docker Desktop programmatically:**
   ```powershell
   Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
   ```
   - Command executes successfully
   - Process starts
   - But Docker daemon never becomes ready

2. **Waited 2.5 minutes (30 attempts × 5 seconds each)**
   - Script waited for Docker to become responsive
   - Checked every 5 seconds with `docker ps`
   - Docker never became ready

---

## Why This Matters

We need Docker to:
1. Build 5 Docker container images with LibreOffice
2. Push images to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
3. Deploy as AWS Lambda functions

**Without Docker running, we cannot proceed with deployment.**

---

## What We Need

**Solution to make Docker Desktop start and run properly on Windows 10**

Possible issues:
- WSL2 not installed/configured?
- Hyper-V disabled?
- Docker service not starting?
- Virtualization disabled in BIOS?
- Docker Desktop requires restart/reinstall?
- Permission issues?

---

## System Check Commands

```powershell
# Check Docker service status
Get-Service -Name "*docker*"

# Check if WSL2 is installed
wsl --list --verbose

# Check Hyper-V
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All

# Check virtualization
systeminfo | findstr /C:"Virtualization"
```

---

## Urgency

**HIGH** - This is blocking deployment of 5 critical Lambda functions for PDF conversion tools. Everything else is ready and configured:
- ✅ AWS credentials configured
- ✅ ECR repositories created
- ✅ Lambda code fixed and ready
- ✅ Dockerfiles prepared with LibreOffice
- ✅ IAM roles configured
- ❌ **Docker not running - BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT**

---

## Expected Behavior

After fixing Docker:
```powershell
docker ps
```

Should return:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

(Empty list is fine, we just need no errors)

---

## Next Steps After Fix

Once Docker is running:
1. Run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build-and-deploy.ps1`
2. Script will automatically:
   - Build 5 Docker images (~30-40 minutes)
   - Push to AWS ECR
   - Create Lambda functions
   - Configure Function URLs
   - Update .env file
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Test PDF conversion tools

**Please provide solution to get Docker Desktop running on Windows 10.**
